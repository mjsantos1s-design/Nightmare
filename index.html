    <article><p>Nightmare mode is the final mode gamemode in TDX that is also the only game mode level lock to level 35. It's also the name for all of the event's modes hard mode, so it's a little confusing, but then to make thing even more confusing in Nightmare mode there is Nightmare the easier one and Ultra the hardest mode in the game. It a bit confusing, but it won't bought more attention after this point for that reason.</p>
    <p>Nightmare has it's only lobby like area with a few details and such. You can look around and such, but it important to mention that Nightmare has it's own maps and at the monent of making this there is 5 being:</p> 
    <p><h2>Castellan Reach (Simple)</h2> <h2><a href="./html/hidden1.html">Finality</a> (Easy)</h2> <h2>Pacifica Ruins (Normal)</h2>  <h2>Supremacy Prime (Normal)</h2> and lasty the hardest of them for now <h2>G.U.N. Facility (Hard)</h2></p>
    <p>Since Ultra and Nightmare are very different in what's in the introdution and even how long they last this intro will finish at the start of either one that can be picked, also the Nightmare soundtrack is at the footer once you enter which mode your going too.</p></article>
