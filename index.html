    <article><p>Nightmare mode is the final mode gamemode in TDX that is also the only game mode level lock to level 35. It's also the name for all of the event's modes hard mode, so a little confusing, but thne in Nightmare mode there is Nightmare the hard one and Ultra the hardest mode. It a bit confusing, so I won't bring attention to it after this point for that reason.</p>
    <p>Nightmare has it's only lobby like area with a few details and such. You can look around and such, but since Ultra and Nightmare are very different in what's in the introdution will finish at the start of either one that can be picked.</p></article>
