    <article>
    <p>Nightmare mode is the last and hardest (Canon) main gamemode. For that reason even though Nightmare unlocks at level 35 I wouldn't recoomed jumping in unless you have friend to carry you through it. Even then though Nightmare is not comparable in difficulty to any other main gamemode.</p>
    <p>For towers we have a lot that can work, but there also a lot that won't like Juggernut. Even though he help a lot in Expert he can't do a lot here, only helping you get to the final boss by spaming top paths, but not have enough dps to let you win. This is why I would say to hold off doing this mode until later as a lot of important towers are level locked to even higher levels, like the replacement of Juggernut, XWM Turret.</p>
    <p>XWM Turret is a great early game tower fo Nightmare that goes into the late game of Nightmare very well with top path being a bullet dps machine and bottom being a great splash damage crowd controler. Along with those two big things it also can repair itself when knocked to 0 health 4 times per tower, and it has 0-0 flying detection that is super important for this mode since by wave 3 there are already flying enemies out.</p>
    <p>Another great tower for Nightmare is either of the two Mobsters. Golen Mobster is super brain dead crazy, but since it also super costly it won't be talked about since does what Mobster does, but better in every way. Now Mobster is a mix of a basic shooter, a spawner, and a eco tower all in one. Of course he isn't the best in everything, but he great at all the things he does. Top path is a more spawner heavy path with an ability that let him ignore bullet resistance for a few seconds, however bottom is the important path for Nightmare. This path give him a ability to put a bounty on a enemy. This bounty will remain on the eneny until they die where you make extra money from their death based on they're health and level of the Mobster.Along with that this path also gives cash back to any tower in his range that dies, that super helpful for keeping eco up during more messy waves in Nightmare.</p>
    <p>Nightmare mode has buff some towers by simply having them being important, and Mobster was one of these towers, but another that had the biggest surge of important was AA Turret. AA Turret was a very interesting tower, as it was added with the expert mode rework and it was for the new flying enemies in the expert rework, however it was very over kill. The highest health flying enemy was 2,000 that isn't a lot, but for flying bosses there was the slow VX drone with 100,000. Still not a lot and not a ton of flying enemies came out at once on expert too. This wouldn't be too much of a problem for other anti-air towers as they could still do damage to other eneimes without a problem, but "AA" in AA Turret's name means "Anti Air", and with that title it was given a special feature. That it could only attack air eneimes. So it didn't get used too much, but now Nightmare is here. Nightmare is filled up with tons of strong and powerful air enemies that need to be kill ASAP. This mode was made for AA Turret, and he makes a almost perfect anti-air for thw whole mode.</p>
    <p>The last super important tower to grab for Nightmare is Medic or if you have enough from expert and stuff Sheild tower. Medic could be not used in expert and you would have a harder time, but is wasn't needed. Here if you don't have anything like medic or any reason not to put him into the line up, then you should have medic. He an amazing healer that can uber a tower that gets in damage. Keep in mind though towers like XWM Turret that can't be buffed also can't be ubered or healed. Sheild Tower is also works as it's another healer, but they will be talked about later as they are a crystal tower.</p>
    <p>There are more towers that should be quickly gone over that you may or may not of picked up from earlier in the game. Edj is still the best support tower in the whole game. John can help here with his top path damage buff, but it not super important. Armored Factory is great early game spawner tower, but don't forget to bring a early high power dps tower like XWM Turret or Golden Juggernut to help control the eneimes for Armored Factory to clean up. Toxicnator is good start off since poison damage doesn't have a resistance type, along with his bottom path speeding up boss kills with weaking debuff her can use. </p>
